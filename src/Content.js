                <h1>Create React App</h1>
                <p>Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React,
                    and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.
                    It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features,
                    provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.
                    Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:
                </p>

            </div>
        </main>
    );
}

export default Content;
